    This is CatchPhrase!  It is like a game of hot potato and charades!
    There are two teams.  Each team takes turns.
    At each turn, one person in the team will be holding the device and
    given a word or phrase on screen.  The goal is to get their
    teammates to guess the given word or phrase without saying it.
    All the while, a timer will be slowly going off.  If it goes off
    during a team\'s turn, the other team gets a point.
    If the timer goes off, the other team also has a chance to try
    to guess what the word / phrase was.  If they correctly guess,
    then they also gain an additional point.  
    This game continues on for a preset amount of rounds and the
    team with the most points at the end wins!
